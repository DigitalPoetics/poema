_"Oratio sensitiva perfecta est POEMA."_  
"By poem we mean a perfect sensate discourse," said Alexander Baumgarten.

Baumgarten continued: "By poem we mean a perfect sensate discourse, by poetics the body of rules to which a poem conforms, by philosophical poetics the science of poetics, by poetry the state of composing a poem, and by poem the man who enjoys the state." (_Reflections on Poetry_, #9)
