_"Oratio sensitiva perfecta est POEMA."_  
"By poem we mean a perfect sensate discourse," said Alexander Baumgarten.

**Poema** uses [wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer.xyz/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to implement [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) display on the browser, somewhat extending the Tones and Breaks Indices (ToBI) framework by including beats and text to analyze rhythm and enjambments of written verse. See [demo](https://digitalpoetics.github.io/poema/).

Baumgarten continued: "By poem we mean a perfect sensate discourse, by poetics the body of rules to which a poem conforms, by philosophical poetics the science of poetics, by poetry the state of composing a poem, and by poem the man who enjoys the state." (_Reflections on Poetry_, #9)
