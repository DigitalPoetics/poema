# poema

See [demo](https://digitalpoetics.github.io/poema/).

**Poema** uses [wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer.xyz/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to implement [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) display on the browser, somewhat extending the Tones and Breaks Indices (ToBI) framework by including beats and text to analyze rhythm and enjambments of verse.
